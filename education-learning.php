                            <p class="section-inr-txt">To do this, it is important to work with a vendor that can offer a portal solution that can integrate with existing information systems used by your school. A common scenario for schools is to integrate portals with the Synergetic Management platform. Information is pulled from Synergetic and made visible in the portal, allowing parents to quickly check absences, parent permissions, medical and other critical information.

                            <p class="section-inr-txt">As far as the end users will be concerned, an education portal will only be as useful as its dashboard allows. A dashboard should be capable of bringing in relevant information from other systems and giving stakeholders access to what they need with an intuitive and user-friendly interface. Dashboards for parent portals in particular, must be customised to present information regarding their child only. At the same time, administrators need access to manage security permissions, to better control the flow of information.
