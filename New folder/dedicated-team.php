                                   Our dedicated team offering is a tried and tested model which allows clients to source a pre-formed, managed team from Godel inclusive of a variety of roles, to embed into their organisation as a separate, permanent, cross functional delivery team which can take on the delivery of mission-critical projects and self manage them through to successful completion.
                                </p>
                                <p class="sub-heading-core">The dedicated team normally comprises of a Business Analyst(s), Project Manager(s), Scrum Master, Developers and Quality Assurance which is brought together as a formed team and is empowered to deal directly with the business stakeholders / product owner and liaise with them on the definition and grooming of the product backlog, sprint planning and subsequent releases.</p>
                                <p class="sub-heading-core">Clients have chosen this model to leverage the right level of talent quickly within a pre-formed team to progress into a delivery plan, which can normally be established far more quickly than in-house internal recruitment teams can muster. In the long-term, the team is also far more cost effective than in-house recruitment too which goes towards helping them manage their department costs, without compromising quality.</p>
